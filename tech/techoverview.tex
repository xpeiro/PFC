\chapter{Technology Overview}
\epigraph{\textit{Technology frightens me to death. It’s designed by engineers to impress other engineers.
And they always come with instruction booklets that are written by engineers for other engineers - which is 
why almost no technology ever works.}}{\textit{John Cleese}}
This chapter will give a general overview of the technologies used in the development of this project. 
This will loosely entail, for each section, a brief history, the current state of the art and how it relates 
to the project. By no means is this intended to be a comprehensive in depth look into each subject, given that 
entire books can and have been written on each of them, but should give the reader enough information to understand 
the following chapter, that details how the system is built and what it does with these technologies.
